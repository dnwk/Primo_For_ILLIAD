# Primo_For_ILLIAD
Primo ILLiad Plugin

This is a fork from IDS Project Alma Primo Plugin<http://idsproject.org/Tools/Addons.aspx>

Install the Plugin in ILLiad Addon folder.
Change config.xml and set your own Primo URL. It is recommanded to create a ILLiad specific view by hide facet or other not needed element and maybe disable the forced login for convenience.

When processing "Loan" request in ILLiad, it will search your Primo by title/isbn depends on your setting. 
When processing "Article" request in ILLiad, it will search your Primo by journal title/issn depends on your setting.
